What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

    We get a new git directory for version control, but without any commits. If we do not do this then there will be no git repo

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

    We get a place where the directory has no additional files for its history and we can choose what to commit, controlling our commit     size. As a side note we get do not pollute the history of the repository in this way.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

   simple we can keep all chenges per file minimal, and so each commit can be of just one small modification.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

   To test experimental features. and see how different developments go through.
