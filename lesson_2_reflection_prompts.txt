What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

    We get a new git directory for version control, but without any commits. If we do not do this then there will be no git repo

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    In the case of files it could take you to any point in time previous to their deletion or inaquete modfication

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Well I personally believe it is better to have the manual try because it makes it meaningfull.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    It could be that more related to the kind of project that is being handled

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    one can use git log to find the id of the commit that might be problematic and compare it to the one before it.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    If you have confidence on the fact that you can safely return to a point where your code was working you could be enticed to try more riskier things.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
