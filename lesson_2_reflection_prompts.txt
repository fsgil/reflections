What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

    We get a new git directory for version control, but without any commits. If we do not do this then there will be no git repo

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

    We get a place where the directory has no additional files for its history and we can choose what to commit, controlling our commit     size. As a side note we get do not pollute the history of the repository in this way.
