When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

   A remote repo would be very helpfull to avoid loss of work if the local computer dies out, and the work is too complicated to replicate in short time.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

   Mostly because auto-updating could interfere with the writing of the files of a project, and this could cause coherence issues.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

   clones allow us to make copies of repos, branches allow us to experiment while being in the same project, forks are more for the collaboration with people who may not be real part of the project in a way.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

   in helps keeping the an idea of how the branches are diverging because of changes introduced.
