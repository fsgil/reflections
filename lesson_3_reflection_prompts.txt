When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

   A remote repo would be very helpfull to avoid loss of work if the local computer dies out, and the work is too complicated to replicate in short time.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

   Mostly because auto-updating could interfere with the writing of the files of a project, and this could cause coherence issues.
